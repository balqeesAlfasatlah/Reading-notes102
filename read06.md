# Control flow 

The **control flow **is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

### The kinds of control flow statements supported by different languages vary, but can be categorized by their effect:

1. Continuation at a different statement (unconditional branch or jump).
2. Executing a set of statements only if some condition is met (choice - i.e., conditional branch).
3. Executing a set of statements zero or more times, until some condition is met (i.e., loop - the same as conditional branch).
4. Executing a set of distant statements, after which the flow of control usually returns (subroutines, coroutines, and continuations).
5. Stopping the program, preventing any further execution (unconditional halt).
