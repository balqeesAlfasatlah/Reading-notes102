# Whats JavaScript ?
**JavaScript**  is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

#  basics of javascript :

  ## Declarations
JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

1. var
Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
2. let
Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
3. const
Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

## Variables
You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0â€“9).


# Data structures and types

**Seven data types that are primitives:**

1. Boolean. true and false.
2. null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.).
3. undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
4. Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
5. BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
6. String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy".
7. Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
