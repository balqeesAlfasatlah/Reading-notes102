## Expressions and operators in javascript :

### Operators :

1. Assignment operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Arithmetic operators
4. Bitwise operators
5. Logical operators
6. String operators
7. Conditional (ternary) operator
8. Comma operator
9. Unary operators
10. Relational operators


 ### Here is an simple explaination about Logical operators as an example :

**Logical operators** are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value. The logical operators are described in the following table.

# Loops :

**Loops** offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

### The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

1. for statement
2. do...while statement
3. while statement
4. labeled statement
5. break statement
6. continue statement
7. for...in statement
8. for...of statement

### Here is an simple explaination about **for statement** as an example :

A **for loop** repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

*A for statement looks as follows:*

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
